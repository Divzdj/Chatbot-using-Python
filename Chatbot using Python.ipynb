    "    \"0.Hi\":\"Hello\",\n",
    "    \"1. What is Python?\": \"Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.\",\n",
    "    \"2. What are the advantages of using Python?\": \"Python offers several advantages such as simplicity, readability, vast community support, extensive libraries, and cross-platform compatibility.\",\n",
    "    \"3.How do you use loops in Python?\": \"Python provides several types of loops including 'for' loops and 'while' loops. 'for' loops are used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) while 'while' loops are used for repeating a block of code as long as a condition is true.\",\n",
    "    \"4. What are Python data types?\": \"Python supports various data types including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.\",\n",
    "    \"5. How do you declare a variable in Python?\": \"Variables in Python can be declared simply by assigning a value to a name. For example, 'x = 10' declares a variable 'x' with the value 10.\",\n",
    "    \"6. What are Python lists?\": \"Lists in Python are ordered collections of items that can be of different data types. They are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after creation.\",\n",
    "    \"7. How do you define  functions iny Python?\": \"Functions in Python are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name and parameters. For example, 'def my_function(param1, param2):'.\",\n",
    "    \"8. What are Python modules?\": \"Modules in Python are files containing Python code that can be imported and used in other Python scripts. They help in organizing code into reusable components.\",\n",
    "    \"9. How do you handle exceptions in Python?\": \"Exceptions in Python are handled using try-except blocks. Code that might raise an exception is placed inside the 'try' block, and the handling code is placed inside the 'except' block.\",\n",
    "    \"10. What are Python libraries?\": \"Python libraries are collections of modules that provide pre-written functionality to solve specific problems. Examples include NumPy for numerical computations, pandas for data analysis, and matplotlib for data visualization.\"\n",
